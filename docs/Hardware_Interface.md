- PD 3.0 Fast Charging & Data Sync
- Optional magnetic snap adapter for field charging

### 2. **Sensor Sync Ports**
- 2x Micro JST 6-pin internal ports (for biometric sensors)
- Used for wrist-band vitals sync, helmet sensors, or vehicle I/O
- Powered 3.3V / 5V switchable

### 3. **Expansion Slot**
- Universal side-mount rail for accessory modules:
  - Thermal imaging add-on
  - NVG booster lens
  - Side-mounted LIDAR or rangefinder
- Controlled via embedded SPI interface

### 4. **Debug / Dev Port**
- Concealed USB-C port (beneath frame panel)
- Exposes CLI interface via serial (TTY or UART)
- Protected by tamper-detect seal
