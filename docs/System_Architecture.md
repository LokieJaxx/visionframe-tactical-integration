# 🧠 VisionFrame Tactical – System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level system architecture of the VisionFrame Tactical AR glasses platform, designed for U.S. military field deployment.

---

## 🗂️ System Overview

VisionFrame Tactical is a modular, AI-integrated augmented reality (AR) wearable built to replace radios, HUDs, binoculars, handheld GPS, and situational tools with a hands-free heads-up experience.

The system operates as a closed-loop edge computing device, utilizing encrypted networking, local AI processing, and synchronized sensor feedback to support tactical decision-making in real time.

## 🔧 Component Breakdown

### 1. **Optical System**
- Dual waveguide displays
- Binocular overlay with real-world passthrough
- Non-obstructive central FOV

### 2. **Vision & Sensory**
- Dual HD cameras for stereoscopic depth, tagging, and motion detection
- Eye-tracking for input and compass alignment
- Optional thermal/IR (modular)

### 3. **Audio + Comms**
- Bone conduction speakers (silent to external observers)
- Subvocal mic for command input
- Encrypted comms module for mesh or satellite sync

### 4. **AI Core**
- Runs offline AI models (object detection, tagging, map overlays)
- Hardware-accelerated using Edge TPU or dedicated AI chip
- Tactically optimized inference engine

### 5. **Overlay Engine**
- Renders real-time compass, GPS, health data, target range
- Dynamic terrain manipulation (e.g., see-through building/tree layers)
- Custom mission overlays per role (medic, recon, command, etc.)

### 6. **Environment & Health Monitoring**
- GPS + wind + barometric sensors
- Wearer vitals via paired wrist sensors
- Squad data sync via command uplink

## 🔐 Security & Resilience

- Military-grade AES-XTS encryption on all local data
- Self-wiping on breach protocols (optional)
- RF-limited operational modes for stealth
- EMP-hardened module variants (planned)

---

## 📡 External Interfaces

- U.S. military comms API support (e.g., ATAK integration planned)
- USB-C debug port (shielded)
- OTA firmware updates through secure mesh relay
