# 🧠 AI Behavior Module – VisionFrame Tactical

This document describes the functional behavior and decision-making logic of the onboard AI used in the VisionFrame Tactical AR system.

---

## 🎯 AI Mission

The onboard AI is trained and optimized for:

- 🟥 Threat recognition and tracking
- 🧭 Navigation, waypoint assistance, and terrain analysis
- 🩺 Squad status monitoring and biometric triage
- 🔗 Communication routing and priority escalation

All processing is performed locally using a dedicated neural core, with optional sync to command center or squad-linked AI via secure mesh or satlink.

## 🧠 Behavior Pipelines

### 1. **Threat Detection Pipeline**
- Realtime object detection (enemy, drone, vehicle, weapon)
- AI assigns threat level: Low / Moderate / High / Critical
- Highlights threat in red/orange/yellow box overlays
- Directional cues added (e.g., red indicator w/ distance)

### 2. **Navigation Support**
- Dynamic waypoint generation based on command path
- Live topographic map reading and path risk assessment
- Suggests alternate routes if line-of-sight is blocked

### 3. **Medical + Vital Response**
- Detects squad members’ vitals (via connected wrist modules)
- Flags vitals outside safe parameters
- Sends direct overlay alert to team medic + command center

### 4. **Silent Command Processing**
- Interprets eye movements and gestures for quick commands
- Can trigger overlays like: “Show threat paths” or “Tag last gunfire”
- Supports head tilts, eye lock, double-blink for silent ops

## 🔒 Security & Integrity

- All data processed on-device with zero cloud reliance
- Encrypted model weights, tamper-detection enabled
- Optional “lockdown mode” disables uplink for stealth missions

## 📌 Notes

- Future modules include facial recognition (FR) for VIP tracking
- Custom datasets can be loaded per mission (e.g. vehicle types, known uniforms)
- AI retraining pipeline stored offline and can be updated via secure OTA

> The VisionFrame AI is designed to assist — not replace — human tactical decisions. It operates as an embedded force multiplier, not a decision authority.
